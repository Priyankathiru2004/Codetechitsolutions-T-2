Description:
The program starts by prompting the user to enter the number of subjects or assignments for which they want to track grades. It uses the input() function to get the user's input and the int() function to convert the input to an integer.
Next, the program enters a loop that iterates the number of times specified by the user. Inside the loop, it prompts the user to enter the grade for each subject or assignment. The grades are stored in a list called grades, and the total marks are accumulated in the variable total_marks.
After collecting all the grades, the program calculates the average grade by dividing the total marks by the number of subjects or assignments.
Next, the program determines the overall grade based on the average grade. It uses conditional statements (if, elif, else) to assign a letter grade to the overall_grade variable. The grading scale used in this example is A for 90 or above, B for 80 or above, C for 70 or above, D for 60 or above, and F for below 60.
Finally, the program calculates the GPA based on the overall grade. It uses another set of conditional statements to assign a GPA value to the gpa variable. In this example, the GPA scale is 4.0 for A, 3.0 for B, 2.0 for C, 1.0 for D, and 0.0 for F.
The program then displays the list of grades, the average grade, the overall grade, and the GPA to the user using the print() function.
In summary, this student grade tracker program allows the user to input grades for different subjects or assignments, calculates the average grade, determines the overall grade and GPA based on the average, and displays the results to the user.
Feel free to customize this program to fit your specific needs, such as modifying the grading scale or adding additional features.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the student grade tracker program in Python provides a convenient way to track and manage grades for different subjects or assignments. The program allows the user to input grades, calculates the average grade, determines the overall grade based on the average, and calculates the GPA.
By using this program, students or educators can easily keep track of grades and have a clear understanding of their overall performance. The program utilizes concepts such as input/output, loops, conditional statements, and lists in Python.
It is worth mentioning that the program can be further enhanced and customized based on specific requirements. For example, you can add additional features like storing grades in a database or file, implementing grade weighting, or generating detailed reports.
Using Python for grade tracking offers flexibility and ease of use, making it an ideal choice for such tasks. Python's extensive libraries and resources also provide opportunities to expand the program's functionality.
Overall, the student grade tracker program in Python provides an efficient and effective way to manage and analyze grades, empowering students and educators with valuable insights into academic performance.
